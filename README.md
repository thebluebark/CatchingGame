# Catching Game
 Unity Project for Exercise 2

 Unity version: 2021.3.19f1

# Game Description
A massive explosion has caused all of the fish and bombs inside of the ocean to start raining down! You should try to catch some of these fish while you can. Avoid the bombs!
Random fish and bombs will spawn at random intervals, you can catch either with your net. But if you catch a bomb, the game is over!

# Game Controls
You can either use the arrow keys or WASD for movement. Although your net will only move horizontally!

# Installation
You can clone the repository to have it locally on your system.
There is also an already built version of this game within the /bin directory if you just want to run it right away.
